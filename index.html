      <p class="lead">
        Vibe coding is about taking an idea and bringing it to life with code, even if you do not know every detail of a programming language. 
        AI can help write the code, explain concepts, and fill in the gaps so the focus stays on the idea itself.
      </p>

      <p class="lead">
        On this site, I share projects I have vibe coded. It is a place to show what can be done when you mix creativity, curiosity, and coding support from AI. 
        Each project is part of my journey exploring what is possible.

      <p class="lead">
        Vibe coding is about energy, experimentation, and expression. It is not just technical, it is creative. 
        This page is where I put that into practice.
